## Universal port in elm.

Would be cool if i dont need to build ports and decoders and crap. If i can have 1 port.. that takes care automagically of converting elm structures to json.. and to firebase stuff..
Use that back and forth automatically..
Would be a big win since i can use node js modules and libs directly.. and have elm compiler back me up.
We do need an encoder.. a transation mechanism from anything to some universal thing like JE.value.. just that needs to be optimized for firebase...

## Have the ability to use tasksk with this unieversal port..

Making many tasks run in paralel.. or sequence.. then resolve them.. then work with their result.. is key.. to acomplish fast easy to read code with no crappy flags like is data loaded or something..


## lolografic stuff
imagine using the same principle of aps fiting on the screen or not.. like a snaping but in 32d.
